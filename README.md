## Creating the Extension from Scratch

### Step 1: Set Up Development Environment

Create a new folder named `Chat_extension` and install the required tools:

```bash
# Install generator (run as administrator)
npm install -g yo generator-code
```

Navigate to where you want to create your extension (e.g., desktop) and run:

```bash
yo code
```

Answer the prompts as follows:

```
? What type of extension do you want to create? 
→ New Extension (JavaScript)

? What's the name of your extension? 
→ Gemini Chat Vsc

? What's the identifier of your extension? 
→ gemini-chat-vsc

? What's the description of your extension? 
→ AI Chat with Gemini API

? Initialize a git repository? 
→ No

? Package manager to use? 
→ npm
```

### Step 2: Project Structure

Your project will have these important files:

```
gemini-chat-vsc/
├── package.json          # Extension manifest
├── extension.js          # Main extension logic
├── README.md            # This file
└── .gitignore           # Git ignore rules
```

### Step 3: Configure the Extension

Replace the `package.json` content with:

[Go To package.json](https://github.com/Yacine20elfadili/gemini-chat-vsc/blob/main/package.json)

Replace the `extension.js` content with:

[Go To extension.js](https://github.com/Yacine20elfadili/gemini-chat-vsc/blob/main/extension.js)

Update the README.md content with this complete documentation.

### Step 4: Test the Extension

1. Open the folder in VS Code
2. Open integrated terminal and run:
   ```bash
   npm run compile
   ```
3. Press `F5` - A new VS Code window will appear with your extension

**Note**: The extension will not work until you configure a Gemini API key.
